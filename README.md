# Game Description

Doomfall is a simple implementation of tetris in `Python` using `pygame`

The goal of DOOMFALL is to strategically place falling blocks in a way to create horizontal row(s) on the screen. When one or more rows is formed, the row disappears, increasing your score and dropping the already placed blocks slightly farther down. As you play the game your score will be increased with each block placed, and every horizontal row cleared. Once you have no more space to place a new block the game is over.

# Controls
The controls for DOOMFALL are quite simple:

- A&D or left&right arrow keys to move left and right respectively
- Q&E to rotate counter-clockwise or clockwise respectively
- SPACE to drop the block all the way down.
